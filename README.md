### What my LinkedIn says about me

"I'm a data scientist who loves puzzles, especially those hidden in data. I'm learning to be a data scientist after working more than 10 years in quality assurance management and test automation. I thrive on the challenge of data science and the energy of communication.

I'm excited by the numbers in data science. Solving tricky problems and discovering new insights through analysis keeps me hooked. But it's not just about finding answers; it's equally important to explain them well"
